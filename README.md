# Baddie App (Flutter) — Minimal Tinder-like Scaffold

This repository contains a minimal Flutter scaffold for a Tinder-like dating app.

Quick start:

1. Install Flutter SDK: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2. From project root run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Notes:
- Add images into `assets/images/` or update profiles to use network images.
- This is a starting scaffold — extend authentication, backend, and match logic.
